<p>My name is Victoria Herrera Arvay, I'm a PhD student in the Spanish and Portuguese department of the University of Maryland.
I'm original from Argentina and I've been studying in the United States since 2019. My research focuses on Latin American literature, specifically the intersection between ruralism and poetics in XX and XXI-century women writers' novels</p>
