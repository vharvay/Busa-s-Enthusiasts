          <p>
I Left Buenos <orig>Ayres</orig>, and took the Road to<lb/> <orig>Cordoua</orig>, leaving Santa Fe on 
my<lb/> right hand, of which place take this ac<lb/>count, <sic>'tis</sic> a Spanish Settlement 
dependant<lb/> upon Buenos <orig>Ayres</orig>, the Commander is<lb/> no more than a Lieutenant, 
and does no<lb/>thing but by order from the Governor<lb/> of Buenos <orig>Ayres</orig>. <sic>'Tis</sic> a 
little place con<lb/>taining 25 Houses, without any Walls, Fortifications, or 
Garrison, distant 80<lb/> Leagues from Buenos <orig>Ayres</orig> Northward,<lb/> Situate upon the 
River de la Plata, large<lb/> Vessels might come up to it, were it not<lb/> for a 
great bank that obstructs the pas<lb/>sage a little above Buenos <orig>Ayres</orig>. 
Ne<lb/>vertheless <sic>'tis</sic> a very advantageous Post,<lb/> because <sic>'tis</sic> the only passage 
from Peru,<lb/> Chili and Tucuman to Paraguay, and in<lb/> a manner the Magazine of 
the Commodi<lb/>
<fw type="catch">ties.</fw> 
 <pb n="25"/>
         <fw type="head">up the R. de la Plata 25</fw>
ties drawn from thence, particularly that<lb/> Herb already spoken 
of, which they<lb/> cannot be without in those Provinces.<lb/> The Soil is as good 
and Fertile here as<lb/> at Buenos <orig>Ayres</orig>; and the Town having<lb/> nothing 
remarkably different from what<lb/> has been <sic>observ'd</sic> of Buenos <orig>Ayres</orig>, I<lb/> leave 
it, and proceed upon my Jour<lb/>ney. <sic>'Tis</sic> counted 140 Leagues from<lb/> Buenos 
<orig>Ayres</orig> to <orig>Cordoua</orig>, and because<lb/> some parts of the Road are uninhabited<lb/> for a 
long way together; I surnished<lb/> my self at my departure with what I<lb/> was 
<sic>inform'd</sic> I should stand in need<lb/> of; so I set out having a Savage for my<lb/> 
Guide, with Three Horses and Three<lb/> Mules, some to carry my Baggage, and<lb/> 
the rest to change upon the way when<lb/> that I rid upon was tired.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
From Buenos <orig>Ayres</orig>, to the River Lu<lb/>can, and even as far as the River 
Recife,<lb/> 30 Leagues, I <sic>pass’d</sic> by several Habita<lb/>tions and Farms cultivated 
by the Spani<lb/>ards, but beyond Recife to the River<lb/> Salladillo, I saw none. 
Let it be obser<lb/>ved by the way, that these Rivers as well<lb/> as all the rest 
in the Provinces of Buenos <orig>Ayres</orig>, Paraguay and Tucuman, that fall<lb/> into the 
River de la Plata are fordable on Horse-back; but when the Rains or<lb/> 
<fw type="catch">any</fw> 
     <pb n="26"/>
      <fw type="head">26 A Voyage to Peru</fw>
any other accident swells them, a Tra<lb/>veller must either swim over, or else get<lb/> 
upon a bundle in the nature of a raft,<lb/> which a Savage hawls over to the 
other<lb/> side. I could not Swim, and so was<lb/> <sic>forc'd</sic> to make use of this 
expedient<lb/> twice or thrice when I could not find a<lb/> Ford. The way was this, 
my Indian<lb/> <sic>kill'd</sic> a Wild Bull, flead the Hide off,<lb/> stuffed it with straw, 
and <sic>ty'd</sic> it up in<lb/> a great bundle with thongs of the same<lb/> Hide, upon which 
I <sic>plac'd</sic> my self with<lb/> my Baggage ; he swam over hawling me<lb/> after him by a 
Cord <sic>ty'd</sic> to the bundle,<lb/> and then he <sic>repass'd</sic> and swam my Horses<lb/> and Mules 
over to me.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
All the Country between the River<lb/> Recife and Salladillo, <sic>tho'</sic> uninhabited,<lb/> 
abounds in Cattle and all sorts of Fruit-<lb/>trees, except Walnut and Chesnut-<lb/>
trees; there are whole Woods of Nectarine-<lb/>Trees, Three or Four Leagues in 
compass,<lb/> that bear excellent Fruit, which they<lb/> not only eat raw, but bake 
them, or dry<lb/> them in the Sun, to keep, as we in France<lb/> do Prunes: They 
seldom use any other<lb/> than the Wood of this Tree for common<lb/> firing at 
Buenos <orig>Ayres</orig>, and thereabouts.<lb/> The Savages that dwell in these Parts are<lb/> 
distinguish'd into two sorts, those that<lb/> 
<fw type="catch">volun-</fw> 
 <pb n="27"/>
         <fw type="head">up the R. de la Plata 27</fw>
voluntarily submit to the Spaniards are<lb/> call’d <foreign><orig>Panpistas</orig></foreign>, the rest <foreign>Serranos</foreign>, both<lb/> cloathed with 
Skins, but the last set up<lb/>on the <orig>Panpistas</orig> as their mortal Enemies<lb/> 
wherever they meet with them. All<lb/> Fight on Horse-back, either with Lances<lb/> 
pointed with Iron or Bones sharpen'd,<lb/> or else with Bows and Arrows, they<lb/> 
wear Bulls-hides fashion'd like a Doublet<lb/> without sleeves, to defend their 
Bodies.<lb/> Their Chiefs that command over them<lb/> in War and Peace, are call’d 
<orig>Couracas</orig>.<lb/> When they take any one of their Ene<lb/>mies, alive or dead, they 
meet all toge<lb/>ther, and after they have reproach'd him,<lb/> that either he or 
his Relations were the<lb/> death of their Kindred or Friends, they<lb/> cut and 
tear him into pieces, which they<lb/> roast a little and eat, making a drinking<lb/> 
Bowl of his Scull. They feed mostly<lb/> upon flesh either raw or dress'd, and<lb/> 
particularly Colts flesh, which they like<lb/> better than Veal. They catch 
abundance<lb/> of Fish likewise in their Rivers, They<lb/> have no settled places of 
aboad, but<lb/> ramble up and down, several Families<lb/> together, and live in 
Tents.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
I could not inform my self exactly<lb/> what Religion they were of, but I was<lb/> 
told that they look'd upon the Sun and<lb/> 
<fw type="catch">Moon</fw> 
     <pb n="28"/>
      <fw type="head">28 A Voyage to Peru</fw>
Moon as Deities and as I travell'd along,<lb/> I saw a Savage upon his knees with his<lb/> Face to the Sun, who cry'd 
out and<lb/> made strange gestures with his Hands<lb/> and Arms. I learn'd from the 
Savage that<lb/> accompany'd me, that he was one of<lb/> those they call'd <foreign>Papas</foreign>, 
who in the<lb/> Morning kneel towards the Sun, and at<lb/> Night towards the Moon, 
to supplicate<lb/> those fancy'd Divinities to be propitious<lb/> to them, to give 
them fair Weather, and<lb/> Victory over their Foes.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
They make no great Ceremony in<lb/> their Marriages ; but when a Relation<lb/> dies, 
after they have rubb’d his body<lb/> with a certain Earth that consumes all but<lb/> 
the Bones, they preserve them, and carry<lb/> as many of them as they can 
convenient<lb/>ly about with them in a sort of Chests,<lb/> and this they do in 
token of their af<lb/>fection to their Kindred ; indeed they<lb/> are not wanting in 
good Offices to them<lb/> during their Lives, nor in their Sickness<lb/> and Death.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
Along the River Salladillo, I took<lb/> notice of a great many Parrats, or 
<orig>Pa<lb/>pagays</orig>, as the Spaniards call them, and<lb/> certain Birds, call’d 
<foreign>Guacamayos</foreign>, whic<lb/> are of divers Colours, and twice or thrice<lb/> as big as a 
Parrat. The River it self is<lb/> 
<fw type="catch">full-</fw> 
 <pb n="29"/>
         <fw type="head">up the R. de la Plata 29</fw>
full of the Fish, call'd Dorado, which is<lb/> very good to eat. There is also a Crea<lb/>ture in it, whether 'tis Meat or 
<sic>Poyson</sic><lb/> no body knows, it has Four Feet and a<lb/> long Tail like a Lizard.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
From Salladillo quite to <orig>Cordoua</orig>, you<lb/> go along a very fine River, that 
abounds<lb/> with Fish, which is neither wide nor<lb/> deep, for it may be forded 
over. On<lb/> the Bank of it you meet with little Plan<lb/>tations every Three or 
Four Leagues ;<lb/> which are like Country Houses inhabi<lb/>ted by Spaniards, 
Portuguese, and the Na<lb/>tives, who have all the necessary acco<lb/>modations of 
Life they can wish, and<lb/> are very Civil and Charitable to Stran<lb/>gers; their 
principal Wealth is in Hor<lb/>ses and Mules, in which they Trade with<lb/> the 
Inhabitants of Peru.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
<orig>Cordoua</orig> is a Town Situate in a pleasant<lb/> and fruitful Plain upon the side 
of a<lb/> River, bigger and broader than that I<lb/> have just spoken of : 'Tis 
compos’d of<lb/> about 400 Houses, Built like those of<lb/> Buenos <orig>Ayres</orig>. It has 
neither Ditches,<lb/> nor Walls, nor Fort for its defence; He<lb/> that Commands it 
is Governor of all<lb/> the Provinces of Tucuman, and tho’ it be<lb/> the place of 
his ordinary Residence, yet<lb/> he is wont now and then, as he sees oc<lb/>
<fw type="catch">casion,</fw> 
     <pb n="30"/>
      <fw type="head">30 A Voyage to Peru</fw>
casion, to go and pass some time at <orig>St.<lb/> Jago de l’Estro</orig>, at St. Miguel de Tucuman,<lb/> 
(which is theCapitalCity of theProvince)<lb/> at Salta and at Xuxui. In each 
of these<lb/> Villages there is a Lieutenant, who has<lb/> under him an Alcalde and 
some Officer<lb/> for the Administration of Justice. The<lb/> Bishop of Tucuman 
likewise usually re<lb/>sides at <orig>Cordoua</orig>, where the Cathedral<lb/> is the only 
Parish Church of the whole<lb/> Town ; but there are divers Convents of<lb/> Monks, 
namely of Dominicans, Recol<lb/>lects, and those of the <orig>Order de la Mer<lb/>cy</orig>: and 
one of Nunns. The Jesuits<lb/> have a College there, and their Chappel<lb/> is the 
finest and richest of all.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
The Inhabitants are Rich in Gold and<lb/> Silver, which they get by the Trade<lb/> 
they have for Mules, with which they<lb/> furnish Peru and other Parts; which 
is<lb/> so considerable, that they sell about 28<lb/> or 30000 of 'em every Year, 
which they<lb/> breed up in their Farms. They usually<lb/> keep 'em till they are 
about Two Years<lb/> old, then expose 'em to Sale, and have<lb/> about Six Patagons 
a piece for 'em.<lb/> The Merchants that come to buy 'em, carry<lb/> 'em to St. 
Jago, to Salta and Xuxui ,<lb/> where they leave 'em for Three Years,<lb/> till they 
are well grown and become<lb/> 
<fw type="catch">strong,-</fw> 
 <pb n="31"/>
         <fw type="head">up the R. de la Plata 31</fw>
strong, and afterwards bring 'em to Pe<lb/>ru, where 
they presently have Vent for<lb/> 'em, because there as well as in the rest<lb/> of 
the Western part of America, the<lb/> greatest part of their Carriage is upon<lb/> 
Mules. The People of <orig>Cordoua</orig> also<lb/> drive a Trade in Cows, which they have<lb/> 
from the <sic>Countrey</sic> of Buenos <orig>Ayres</orig>, and<lb/> carry to Peru, where without this 
way<lb/> of Subsistance 'tis certain they would<lb/> have much ado to live. This 
kind of<lb/> <sic>Traffick</sic> makes this Town the most con<lb/>siderable in the Province of 
Tucuman,<lb/> as well for its Riches and Commodities,<lb/> as for the Number of its 
Inhabitants,<lb/> which are counted to be at least 5 or 600 Families, besides 
Slaves who are<lb/> three times the number. But the gene<lb/>rality of 'em of all 
degrees have no other<lb/> Arms but a Sword and Poignard, and<lb/> are very 
indifferent <sic>Souldiers</sic>, the Air<lb/> of the Country, and the Plenty they<lb/> enjoy, 
rendring them Lazy and Cowardly.<lb/>
