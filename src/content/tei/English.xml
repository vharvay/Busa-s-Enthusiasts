   <head>Monsieur Acarete du Biscay's Journey from Buenos Ayres to Peru.</head>
     <div>
          <p>
              
I Left Buenos Ayres, and took the Road to<lb/> Cordoua, leaving Santa Fe on 
my<lb/> right hand, of which place take this ac<lb/>count, 'tis a Spanish Settlement 
dependant<lb/> upon Buenos Ayres, the Commander is<lb/> no more than a Lieutenant, 
and does no<lb/>thing but by order from the Governor<lb/> of Buenos Ayres. 'Tis a 
little place con<lb/>taining 25 Houses, without any Walls, Fortifications, or 
Garrison, distant 80<lb/> Leagues from Buenos Ayres Northward,<lb/> Situate upon the 
River de la Plata, large<lb/> Vessels might come up to it, were it not<lb/> for a 
great bank that obstructs the pas<lb/>sage a little above Buenos Ayres. 
Ne<lb/>vertheless 'tis a very advantageous Post,<lb/> because 'tis the only passage 
from Peru,<lb/> Chili and Tucuman to Paraguay, and in<lb/> a manner the Magazine of 
the Commodi<lb/>ties drawn from thence, particularly that<lb/> Herb already spoken 
of, which they<lb/> cannot be without in those Provinces.<lb/> The Soil is as good 
and Fertile here as<lb/> at Buenos Ayres; and the Town having<lb/> nothing 
remarkably different from what<lb/> has been observ'd of Buenos Ayres, I<lb/> leave 
it, and proceed upon my Jour<lb/>ney. 'Tis counted 140 Leagues from<lb/> Buenos 
Ayres to Cordoua, and because<lb/> some parts of the Road are uninhabited<lb/> for a 
long way together; I surnished<lb/> my self at my departure with what I<lb/> was 
inform'd I should stand in need<lb/> of; so I set out having a Savage for my<lb/> 
Guide, with Three Horses and Three<lb/> Mules, some to carry my Baggage, and<lb/> 
the rest to change upon the way when<lb/> that I rid upon was tired.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
From Buenos Ayres, to the River Lucan, and even as far as the River 
Recife, 30 Leagues, I pass’d by several Habitations and Farms cultivated 
by the Spaniards, but beyond Recife to the River Salladillo, I saw none. 
Let it be observed by the way, that these Rivers as well as all the rest 
in the Provinces of Buenos Ayres, Paraguay and Tucuman, that fall into the 
River de la Plata are fordable on Horse-back; but when the Rains or any 
other accident swells them, a Traveller must either swim over, or else get 
upon a bundle in the nature of a raft, which a Savage hawls over to the 
other side. I could not Swim, and so was forc'd to make use of this 
expedient twice or thrice when I could not find a Ford. The way was this, 
my Indian kill'd a Wild Bull, flead the Hide off, stuffed it with straw, 
and ty'd it up in a great bundle with thongs of the same Hide, upon which 
I plac'd my self with my Baggage ; he swam over hawling me after him by a 
Cord ty'd to the bundle, and then he repass'd and swam my Horses and Mules 
over to me.
</p>
<p>
All the Country between the River Recife and Salladillo, tho' uninhabited, 
abounds in Cattle and all sorts of Fruit trees, except Walnut and Chesnut-
trees; there are whole Woods of Nectarine-Trees, Three or Four Leagues in 
compass, that bear excellent Fruit, which they not only eat raw, but bake 
them, or dry them in the Sun, to keep, as we in France do Prunes: They 
seldom use any other than the Wood of this Tree for common firing at 
Buenos Ayres, and thereabouts. The Savages that dwell in these Parts are 
distinguish'd into two sorts, those that voluntarily submit to the 
Spaniards are call’d Panpistas, the rest Serranos, both cloathed with 
Skins, but the last set up on the Panpistas as their mortal Enemies 
wherever they meet with them. All Fight on Horse-back, either with Lances 
pointed with Iron or Bones sharpen'd, or else with Bows and Arrows, they 
wear Bulls-hides fashion'd like a Doublet without sleeves, to defend their 
Bodies. Their Chiefs that command over them in War and Peace, are call’d 
Couracas. When they take any one of their Enemies, alive or dead, they 
meet all together, and after they have reproach'd him, that either he or 
his Relations were the death of their Kindred or Friends, they cut and 
tear him into pieces, which they roast a little and eat, making a drinking 
Bowl of his Scull. They feed mostly upon flesh either raw or dress'd, and 
particularly Colts flesh, which they like! better than Veal. They catch 
abundance of Fish likewise in their Rivers, They have no settled places of 
aboad, but ramble up and down, several Families together, and live in 
Tents.
</p>
<p>
I could not inform my self exactly what Religion they were of, but I was 
told that they look'd upon the Sun and Moon as Deities and as I travell'd 
along, I saw a Savage upon his knees with his Face to the Sun, who cry'd 
out and made strange gestures with his Hands and Arms. I learn'd from the 
Savage that accompany'd me, that he was one of those they call'd Papas, 
who in the Morning kneel towards the Sun, and at Night towards the Moon, 
to supplicate those fancy'd Divinities to be propitious to them, to give 
them fair Weather, and Victory over their Foes.
</p>
<p>
They make no great Ceremony in their Marriages ; but when a Relation dies, 
after they have rubb’d his body with a certain Earth that consumes all but 
the Bones, they preserve them, and carry as many of them as they can 
conveniently about with them in a sort of Chests, and this they do in 
token of their affection to their Kindred ; indeed they are not wanting in 
good Offices to them during their Lives, nor in their Sickness and Death.
</p>
<p>
Along the River Salladillo, I took notice of a great many Parrats, or 
Papagays, as the Spaniards call them, and certain Birds, call’d 
Guacamayos, which are of divers Colours, and twice or thrice as big as a 
Parrat. The River it self is full of the Fish, call'd Dorado, which is 
very good to eat. There is also a Creature in it, whether 'tis Meat or 
Poyson no body knows, it has Four Feet and a long Tail like a Lizard.
</p>
<p>
From Salladillo quite to Cordoua, you go along a very fine River, that 
abounds with Fish, which is neither wide nor deep, for it may be forded 
over. On the Bank of it you meet with little Plan tations every Three or 
Four Leagues ; which are like Country Houses inhabited by Spaniards, 
Portuguese, and the Natives, who have all the necessary accomodations of 
Life they can wish, and are very Civil and Charitable to Strangers; their 
principal Wealth is in Horses and Mules, in which they Trade with the 
Inhabitants of Peru.
</p>
<p>
Cordoua is a Town Situate in a pleasant and fruitful Plain upon the side 
of a River, bigger and broader than that I have just spoken of : 'Tis 
compos’d of about 400 Houses, Built like those of Buenos Ayres. It has 
neither Ditches, nor Walls, nor Fort for its defence; He that Commands it 
is Governor of all the Provinces of Tucuman, and tho’ it be the place of 
his ordinary Residence, yet he is wont now and then, as he sees occasion, 
to go and pass some time at St. Jago de l’Estro, at St. Miguel de Tucuman, 
(which is the Capital City of the Province) at Salta and at Xuxui. In each 
of these Villages there is a Lieutenant, who has under him an Alcalde and 
some Officers for the Administration of Justice. The Bishop of Tucuman 
likewise usually resides at Cordoua, where the Cathedral is the only 
Parish Church of the whole Town, but there are divers Convents of Monks, 
namely of Dominicans, Recollects, and those of the Order de la Mercy: and 
one of Nunns. The Jesuits have a College there, and their Chappel is the 
finest and richest of all.
</p>
<p>
The Inhabitants are Rich in Gold and Silver, which they get by the Trade 
they have for Mules, with which they furnish Peru and other Parts; which 
is so considerable, that they sell about 28 or 30000 of 'em every Year, 
which they breed up in their Farms. They usually keep 'em till they are 
about Two Years old, then expose 'em to Sale, and have about Six Patagons 
a piece for 'em. The Merchants that come to buy 'em, carry 'em to St. 
Jago, to Salta and Xuxui , where they leave 'em for Three Years, till they 
are well grown and become strong, and afterwards bring 'em to Peru, where 
they presently have Vent for 'em, because there as well as in the rest of 
the Western part of America, the greatest part of their Carriage is upon 
Mules. The People of Cordoua also drive a Trade in Cows, which they have 
from the Countrey of Buenos Ayres, and carry to Peru, where without this 
way of Subsistance 'tis certain they would have much ado to live. This 
kind of Traffick makes this Town the most considerable in the Province of 
Tucuman, as well for its Riches and Commodities, as for the Number of its 
Inhabitants, which are counted to be at least 5 or 600 Families, besides 
Slaves who are three times the number. But the gene rality of 'em of all 
degrees have no other Arms but a Sword and Poignard, and are very 
indifferent Souldiers, the Air of the Country, and the Plenty they enjoy, 
rendring them Lazy and Cowardly.
