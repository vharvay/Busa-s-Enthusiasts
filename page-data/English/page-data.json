'Tis a \nlittle place containing 25 Houses, without any Walls, Fortifications, or \nGarrison, distant 80 Leagues from Buenos Ayres Northward, Situate upon the \nRiver de la Plata, large Vessels might come up to it, were it not for a \ngreat bank that obstructs the passage a little above Buenos Ayres. \nNevertheless 'tis a very advantageous Post, because 'tis the only passage \nfrom Peru, Chili and Tucuman to Paraguay, and in a manner the Magazine of \nthe Commodities drawn from thence, particularly that Herb already spoken \nof, which they cannot be without in those Provinces. The Soil is as good \nand Fertile here as at Buenos Ayres; and the Town having nothing \nremarkably different from what has been observ'd of Buenos Ayres, I leave \nit, and proceed upon my Journey. 'Tis counted 140 Leagues from Buenos \nAyres to Cordoua, and because some parts of the Road are uninhabited for a \nlong way together; I surnished my self at my departure with what I was \ninform'd I should stand in need of; so I set out having a Savage for my \nGuide, with Three Horses and Three Mules, some to carry my Baggage, and \nthe rest to change upon the way when that I rid upon was tired.\nFrom Buenos Ayres, to the River Lucan, and even as far as the River \nRecife, 30 Leagues, I pass’d by several Habitations and Farms cultivated \nby the Spaniards, but beyond Recife to the River Salladillo, I saw none. \nLet it be observed by the way, that these Rivers as well as all the rest \nin the Provinces of Buenos Ayres, Paraguay and Tucuman, that fall into the \nRiver de la Plata are fordable on Horse-back; but when the Rains or any \nother accident swells them, a Traveller must either swim over, or else get \nupon a bundle in the nature of a raft, which a Savage hawls over to the \nother side. I could not Swim, and so was forc'd to make use of this \nexpedient twice or thrice when I could not find a Ford. The way was this, \nmy Indian kill'd a Wild Bull, flead the Hide off, stuffed it with straw, \nand ty'd it up in a great bundle with thongs of the same Hide, upon which \nI plac'd my self with my Baggage ; he swam over hawling me after him by a \nCord ty'd to the bundle, and then he repass'd and swam my Horses and Mules \nover to me.\nAll the Country between the River Recife and Salladillo, tho' uninhabited, \nabounds in Cattle and all sorts of Fruit trees, except Walnut and Chesnut-\ntrees; there are whole Woods of Nectarine-Trees, Three or Four Leagues in \ncompass, that bear excellent Fruit, which they not only eat raw, but bake \nthem, or dry them in the Sun, to keep, as we in France do Prunes: They \nseldom use any other than the Wood of this Tree for common firing at \nBuenos Ayres, and thereabouts. The Savages that dwell in these Parts are \ndistinguish'd into two sorts, those that voluntarily submit to the \nSpaniards are call’d Panpistas, the rest Serranos, both cloathed with \nSkins, but the last set up on the Panpistas as their mortal Enemies \nwherever they meet with them. All Fight on Horse-back, either with Lances \npointed with Iron or Bones sharpen'd, or else with Bows and Arrows, they \nwear Bulls-hides fashion'd like a Doublet without sleeves, to defend their \nBodies. Their Chiefs that command over them in War and Peace, are call’d \nCouracas. When they take any one of their Enemies, alive or dead, they \nmeet all together, and after they have reproach'd him, that either he or \nhis Relations were the death of their Kindred or Friends, they cut and \ntear him into pieces, which they roast a little and eat, making a drinking \nBowl of his Scull. They feed mostly upon flesh either raw or dress'd, and \nparticularly Colts flesh, which they like! better than Veal. They catch \nabundance of Fish likewise in their Rivers, They have no settled places of \naboad, but ramble up and down, several Families together, and live in \nTents.\nI could not inform my self exactly what Religion they were of, but I was \ntold that they look'd upon the Sun and Moon as Deities and as I travell'd \nalong, I saw a Savage upon his knees with his Face to the Sun, who cry'd \nout and made strange gestures with his Hands and Arms. I learn'd from the \nSavage that accompany'd me, that he was one of those they call'd Papas, \nwho in the Morning kneel towards the Sun, and at Night towards the Moon, \nto supplicate those fancy'd Divinities to be propitious to them, to give \nthem fair Weather, and Victory over their Foes.\nThey make no great Ceremony in their Marriages ; but when a Relation dies, \nafter they have rubb’d his body with a certain Earth that consumes all but \nthe Bones, they preserve them, and carry as many of them as they can \nconveniently about with them in a sort of Chests, and this they do in \ntoken of their affection to their Kindred ; indeed they are not wanting in \ngood Offices to them during their Lives, nor in their Sickness and Death.\nAlong the River Salladillo, I took notice of a great many Parrats, or \nPapagays, as the Spaniards call them, and certain Birds, call’d \nGuacamayos, which are of divers Colours, and twice or thrice as big as a \nParrat. The River it self is full of the Fish, call'd Dorado, which is \nvery good to eat. There is also a Creature in it, whether 'tis Meat or \nPoyson no body knows, it has Four Feet and a long Tail like a Lizard.\nFrom Salladillo quite to Cordoua, you go along a very fine River, that \nabounds with Fish, which is neither wide nor deep, for it may be forded \nover. On the Bank of it you meet with little Plan tations every Three or \nFour Leagues ; which are like Country Houses inhabited by Spaniards, \nPortuguese, and the Natives, who have all the necessary accomodations of \nLife they can wish, and are very Civil and Charitable to Strangers; their \nprincipal Wealth is in Horses and Mules, in which they Trade with the \nInhabitants of Peru.\nCordoua is a Town Situate in a pleasant and fruitful Plain upon the side \nof a River, bigger and broader than that I have just spoken of : 'Tis \ncompos’d of about 400 Houses, Built like those of Buenos Ayres. It has \nneither Ditches, nor Walls, nor Fort for its defence; He that Commands it \nis Governor of all the Provinces of Tucuman, and tho’ it be the place of \nhis ordinary Residence, yet he is wont now and then, as he sees occasion, \nto go and pass some time at St. Jago de l’Estro, at St. Miguel de Tucuman, \n(which is the Capital City of the Province) at Salta and at Xuxui. In each \nof these Villages there is a Lieutenant, who has under him an Alcalde and \nsome Officers for the Administration of Justice. The Bishop of Tucuman \nlikewise usually resides at Cordoua, where the Cathedral is the only \nParish Church of the whole Town, but there are divers Convents of Monks, \nnamely of Dominicans, Recollects, and those of the Order de la Mercy: and \none of Nunns. The Jesuits have a College there, and their Chappel is the \nfinest and richest of all.\nThe Inhabitants are Rich in Gold and Silver, which they get by the Trade \nthey have for Mules, with which they furnish Peru and other Parts; which \nis so considerable, that they sell about 28 or 30000 of 'em every Year, \nwhich they breed up in their Farms. They usually keep 'em till they are \nabout Two Years old, then expose 'em to Sale, and have about Six Patagons \na piece for 'em. The Merchants that come to buy 'em, carry 'em to St. \nJago, to Salta and Xuxui , where they leave 'em for Three Years, till they \nare well grown and become strong, and afterwards bring 'em to Peru, where \nthey presently have Vent for 'em, because there as well as in the rest of \nthe Western part of America, the greatest part of their Carriage is upon \nMules. The People of Cordoua also drive a Trade in Cows, which they have \nfrom the Countrey of Buenos Ayres, and carry to Peru, where without this \nway of Subsistance 'tis certain they would have much ado to live. This \nkind of Traffick makes this Town the most considerable in the Province of \nTucuman, as well for its Riches and Commodities, as for the Number of its \nInhabitants, which are counted to be at least 5 or 600 Families, besides \nSlaves who are three times the number. But the gene rality of 'em of all \ndegrees have no other Arms but a Sword and Poignard, and are very \nindifferent Souldiers, the Air of the Country, and the Plenty they enjoy, \nrendring them Lazy and Cowardly.\n          </tei-p>\n     </tei-div>\n     </tei-body>\n </tei-text>\n</tei-TEI>","elements":["tei-TEI","tei-teiHeader","tei-fileDesc","tei-titleStmt","tei-title","tei-publicationStmt","tei-p","tei-sourceDesc","tei-text","tei-body","tei-pb","tei-head","tei-div"]}},"staticQueryHashes":["3064831728"]}
